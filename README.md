I created this "game" when I was learning about procedural generation and wanted to test some things out. I originally hoped to make a simple but interesting computer generated fantasy world. However, the math of procedural generation was what I was really interested in, and after I got what I could out of that I didn't continue working on it.

There are some demo videos available online: [1](https://people.ucsc.edu/~spjpeter/arch/dump/globalwarming.mp4), [2](https://people.ucsc.edu/~spjpeter/arch/dump/intro_anim.mp4), [3](https://people.ucsc.edu/~spjpeter/arch/dump/puddles.mp4), and [4](https://people.ucsc.edu/~spjpeter/arch/dump/stolenart.mp4).
